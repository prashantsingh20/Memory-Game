## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time


## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
